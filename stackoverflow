== Basic Queries

Labels in the graph and counts for each:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n) as label, count(*) as freq
ORDER BY freq DESC;
----

Relationship-types in the graph and counts for eachabel:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[r]->()
RETURN type(r) as type, count(*) as freq
ORDER BY freq DESC;
----

== Top Tags

Which are the most popular tags?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (q:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(t:Tag)
RETURN t.name,  count(q) AS questions
ORDER BY questions DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

== Exploring Users

Who are the top users asking questions?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:ASKED]->(q:Question)
RETURN u.display_name, count(*) AS questions
ORDER by questions DESC 
LIMIT 10;
----

Who's answering? 

Ordered by number of answers 

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:PROVIDED]->(a:Answer)-[:ANSWERED]->(q:Question)
RETURN u.display_name as user,COUNT(a) AS answers, avg(a.score) as avg_score
ORDER BY answers DESC LIMIT 10;
----

Ordered by max score, filtered for a particular tag

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:PROVIDED]->(a:Answer)-[:ANSWERED]->
      (q:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(:Tag {name:"cypher"})
RETURN u.display_name as user,COUNT(a) AS answers, max(a.score) as max_score
ORDER BY max_score DESC LIMIT 10;
----

What's the shortest path between users?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = allShortestPaths(
  (u1:User {display_name:"alexanoid"})-[*]-(u2:User {display_name:"InverseFalcon"})
)
RETURN path LIMIT 1;
----

== User Engagement

User engagement over time:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:PROVIDED]->()-[:ANSWERED]->
      (q:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(t:Tag)
WHERE u.display_name = "InverseFalcon"
RETURN apoc.date.format(q.creation_date,'s','yyyy-MM') as month, 
       count(distinct q) as count, collect(distinct t.name) as tags
ORDER BY month asc
----

== Unanswered Questions

What are the tags for unanswered questions?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (q:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(t:Tag)
WHERE NOT t.name IN ['neo4j','cypher'] 
  AND NOT (q)<-[:ANSWERED]-()
RETURN t.name as tag, count(q) AS questions
ORDER BY questions DESC LIMIT 10;
----

== How are tags related to other tags?

Tag correlations:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t1:Tag)<-[:TAGGED]-()-[:TAGGED]->(t2:Tag)
WHERE id(t1) < id(t2) and t1.name <> 'neo4j' and t2.name <> 'neo4j'
RETURN t1.name, t2.name,count(*) as freq
ORDER BY freq desc LIMIT 10;
----

== Virtual Graphs: Tags

Project tags via co-occurrence with virtual relationships.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t1:Tag)<-[:TAGGED]-()-[:TAGGED]->(t2:Tag)
WHERE id(t1) < id(t2) and t1.name <> 'neo4j' and t2.name <> 'neo4j'
WITH t1, t2,count(*) as freq  where freq > 3
RETURN t1,t2, apoc.create.vRelationship(t1,'OCCURRED',{freq:freq},t2) as rel
----

If you want to you can also materialize those relationships in the graph and then explore the data in Browser or Bloom visually forming clusters.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t1:Tag)<-[:TAGGED]-()-[:TAGGED]->(t2:Tag)
WHERE id(t1) < id(t2) and t1.name <> 'neo4j' and t2.name <> 'neo4j'
WITH t1, t2,count(*) as freq  where freq > 3
MERGE (t1)-[r:OCCURRED]-(t2) SET r.freq=freq
RETURN count(*)
----

== Virtual Graphs: Social Network

We can do something similar for commenters - what users keep on running into each other in the comments? 

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p1=(u1:User)-[:COMMENTED]->(c1:Comment)-[:COMMENTED_ON]-(q:Question)
MATCH p2=(u2:User)-[:COMMENTED]->(c2:Comment)-[:COMMENTED_ON]-(q)
WHERE id(u1) < id(u2)
WITH u1, u2, count(distinct q) as freq
WHERE freq > 2
RETURN u1, u2, apoc.create.vRelationship(u1,'OCCURRED',{freq:freq},u2) as rel
