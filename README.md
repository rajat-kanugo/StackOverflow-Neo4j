## Overview

This repository contains a set of Cypher queries for analyzing a social network modeled in a graph database, specifically focusing on interactions within a question-and-answer platform. The queries facilitate exploration of relationships between various entities, allowing for insights into user engagement and content interactions.

## Key Relationships

The relationships between the nodes demonstrate:

- **User Interactions**:
  - What `User` `ASKED` a `Question`
  - What `User` `PROVIDED` an `Answer`
  - What `User` `COMMENTED` on a `Comment`

- **Content Relationships**:
  - What `Answer` `ANSWERED` a `Question`
  - What `Comment` is `COMMENTED_ON` a `Question`
  - What `Question` is `TAGGED` with a `Tag`

## Node Types

The following nodes are represented in the graph:

- **Users**: Individuals who participate by asking questions, providing answers, or commenting.
- **Questions**: Queries posed by users that may be answered by others.
- **Answers**: Responses to questions, which can be marked as accepted.
- **Comments**: Additional insights or discussions related to questions and answers.
- **Tags**: Keywords that categorize questions, helping to organize content by topics.

## Features

This code enables you to:

- **Model Social Data as Graphs**: Understand how users, questions, answers, comments, and tags interconnect in a social network.
- **Query the Graph**: Utilize Cypher queries to retrieve data and generate insights about user behavior and question engagement.
- **Analyze Relationships**: Implement shortest path algorithms to uncover relationships between users and content, enhancing the understanding of user engagement dynamics.
